- This game was made for the Game Off game jam 2022 * link : https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022 *

- The game jam theme was Cliché

- The game was made using GameMaker Studio 2 using GameMaker programming language

- Expect bugs, this is my first time making a game with GameMaker Studio 2.

- This game will be updated, and maybe, just MAYBE, I'll realease it to more platforms, add lore, make a final game and not just a silly little rage game ;)

Can you beat the unbeatble? And you thought that this card game was a game of luck, huh?
Pathetic. I'll intercept your every move, trying to stop you from winning.
If you loose I know how will you play your next game, and I'll win over and over!

-NO, no... HOW-w?
This is iMpOsSiBlE!!!!!
